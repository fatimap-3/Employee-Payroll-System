#Employee-Payroll-System
Designed and implemented an efficient Employee Payroll System using Java, embodying core Object-Oriented Programming principles. Demonstrated expertise in abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance by creating abstract classes and concrete subclasses for both full-time and part-time employees. Developed a terminal-based user interface for seamless interaction and employed polymorphism and method overloading to calculate salaries. Managed employee records facilitated salary updates, and removal through a robust payroll system, showcasing a solid understanding of software development, OOP design, and system functionality.
